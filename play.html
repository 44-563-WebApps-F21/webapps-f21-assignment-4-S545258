<h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>
<h3>Act-3 Morning-room at the Manor House, Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window looking out into the garden</h3>

    <h6>GWENDOLEN.</h6>
    <p id="speech">The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
    else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
    shame left.</p>
    
<h6>CECILY.</h6>
 <p class="speech"> They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.</p>
    
<h6> GWENDOLEN.</h6>
    <p class="stagedirections">  [After a pause.] </p>
      <p class="speech"> They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you cough?</p>
    
    
 <h6>CECILY.</h6>
 <p class="speech">  But I haven’t got a cough.</p>
    
 <h6> GWENDOLEN. 
  <p class="speech"> They’re looking at us. What effrontery!</p>
    
 <h6> CECILY.</h6>
 <p class="speech"> They’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.</p>
    
 <h6> GWENDOLEN.</h6>
 <p class="speech"> Let us preserve a dignified silence.</p>
    
 <h6> CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech">  Certainly. It’s the only thing to do now.</p> 
     <p class="stagedirections"> [Enter Jack followed by  Algernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]</p>
                               
    
  <h6>GWENDOLEN.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.</p>
    
 <h6> CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> A most distasteful one.</p>
